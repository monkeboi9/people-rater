# people-rater
a cool bash script to rate people.
currently in this script you can rate girls based on multiple variables, tits, ass, personality, and face.
each variable is weighted and then averaged.
you can change the weight by changed the variables right at the beggining of the file.
Will add new features, such as boys, flags, and more clear code.
